    <p>When you go the same ways everyday, walk on the same streets, always take the same bus,
      just to catch the same tube, you slowly get blind. You get blind for what happens around
      you and what everything looks like. When the newness fades away, the excitement about the
      city disappears and people can actually see your face because it is not constantly hidden
      behind your camera, you get stuck. Trying to break out of this horrible thing called routine,
      I took these pictures in the 106 bus to Finsbury Park, one of those everyday-moments, when
      I am usually in a hurry, headphones plugged in and I am completely blind for everything and
      everybody around me. Who would've thought that a bus ride could be that photogenic?
      The matching colours, the light and the little details... I mean, how could I NOT see this
      until now? It literally took me six months to take this photos but I think it was worth it,
      wasn't it?

    <p>I can consider myself very lucky as many lovely people are visiting me here during my time in
      London, and I always try to show them as much as possible of 'my' city. Something I tend to do
      with my visitors is an alternative walking tour about the street art scene around East London,
      guided by young people who are mostly street artists themselves. It showcases East London's
      incredible creativity whilst giving insights into important historical and cultural events that
      have made the area what it is today. So if you are visiting London – or live here – and want to
      experience another face of the city, getting to know the east (aka the cool shit) better, this is
      something I highly recommend. To all my friends visiting me in the future: You know what you're
      in for!

    <p>As I already mentioned, friends from home visited me and we spent a perfect weekend together.
      Sitting in cute little cafés (more on that might follow later), taking random buses through the
      city, sitting in pubs, dancing through thrift shops, trying on about a million crazy sunglasses,
      laughing about old insider jokes. It was a superb mini-holiday and – thank god! – my camera rose
      from the death just in time. The pictures you can see above are all taken on Brick Lane, one of
      my favourite spots in London. I could tell you a lot about the history of that street and what
      it is now but the best thing is just to go there and experience it all by yourself. Just a little
      foretaste: The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and you can smell really good, authentic street
      food on every corner. You will see tons and tons of vintage clothing (especially on sundays since
      that is market day) which already makes it my personal heaven. Ahhh… I’m gonna miss that place. I
      think I will visit London once in a while just to stroll over Brick Lane.

    <p>Over eight million habitants and countless tourists are rushing trough
       London every day. When you see how many people are on the streets it makes
       it hard to imagine that there are always huge crowds under the ground, too.
       But eventhough those numbers of people blow your mind, the system to get them
       all to their destination points everywhere in the city works. Yes, the transport
       in London is as reliable as Barney Stinson suiting up. It always surprises me
       that it is actually possible to get from X to Y without any problems, that you
       don't have to wait for your tube longer than five minutes and everybody is completely
       calm and not stressed at all, especially because the transport 'system' in my hometown
       just sucks. Sorry Rheinbahn. Plus, the underground stations make such a beautiful
       scenery for taking photos, don't you think? I actually really grew fond of the motion and the colours
       under the ground. Isn't it great that all the stations look different? The coloured tiles
       and all the lights are usually something you just rush by without noticing. I can just say
       it again: open your eyes, take your time, don't lose your excitement. Great moments are
       waiting everywhere.

    <p>Ok, sometimes it does rain in London. As much as I have been going on about the
      better-than-expected-weather here so far, I just have to admit that last week I felt like the
      apocalypse was finally there. Like a 2012 in the early days of 2015. And I had to go out, get
      some shit done. Five minutes seconds passed and I was already soaking. Yeeyy. But then, all of
      a sudden, the sun came out and covered the wet streets in such a beautiful golden light, that I
      just couldn't stop myself from  pushing the release of my camera. I literally stood in the middle
      of the streets, cars honking and people shouting at me (sorry, not sorry) but oh, it was so
      worth it! Those little moments make me just so incredibly happy. That's it, nothing more to say
      for today.

    <p>Slowly, so slowly that you almost don't notice, autumn is sneaking into London and is making itself
      at home. It still seems to hesitate a bit, and while the leaves are turning red, there are still days
      that feel like late summer (but October basically translates into autumn, right?). I love this time
      of the year when you become more aware of the nature, start enjoying the colours of autumn and
      gratefully soak up every bit of sunlight you can get before you are freezing your a** off again. It's
      half-term at the moment so we have lots of free time to use just like that. To be honest, this is what
      I am doing constantly here in the city: enjoying my time and being incredibly grateful for everything
      that I've got. Speaking of autumn: it's Halloween on friday, folks, and I am as excited as the kids
      are! We already carved two badass pumpkins and I got my hands on a perfect zombie-bride-dress. Also,
      my mum and bro are visiting me this weekend and I am really looking forward to spending a great time
      with them in my new hometown.
